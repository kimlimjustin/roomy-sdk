# Roomy SDK

> [!NOTE]  
> The Roomy SDK has been moved to the main [Roomy App repository](https://github.com/muni-town/roomy/tree/main/packages/sdk). This repository is now archived.

Welcome to the Roomy SDK! The Roomy SDK is the core behind the [roomy.chat](https://roomy.chat) app, and allows you to interact with Roomy spaces, channels, etc. in your own app, or lets you build your own customized chat application.

See the [API documentation](https://muni-town.github.io/roomy-sdk) for more information.
